# Data API Documentation

## Overview

The Data API provides a robust framework for building data-driven APIs with a focus on CRUD operations. It extends the core API interface with specialized functionality for handling database records, making it simple to create RESTful endpoints for your data models. This interface is designed to streamline the process of connecting your data models to HTTP endpoints, with built-in support for filtering, sorting, pagination, and field access control.

This documentation covers the development version (`beta`) of the interface, which is currently in pre-release stage and may undergo changes before the final release.
